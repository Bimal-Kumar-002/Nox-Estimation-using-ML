<h3> In the recent times to control polluted environment is the big challenge for India, from last five year 
we have seen that in the winter season especially in the Delhi area occurred many problems due to 
air pollution, there is the various source that contributes to air pollution. Since
Delhi has 13 Thermal power plant in the radius 300 Km. Emission of the Nitrogen oxide from the 
thermal power plant is one of the contributors to pollute the Air.
It is responsible for photochemical smog, visibility reduction, acid rain & ozone depletion. Hence 
there is a strong need to reduce the NOx emission from Thermal Power Plant. 
In recent time data-driven technology is used by the many Country across the globe to analyses the 
data and find a more effective way to minimize the NOx emission from the Thermal Power Plant.
We have collected the data from 410 MW Thermal Power Plant under the supervision of the expert 
in this area. We have used data visualization technique to analyses the relationship between the 
various dependent variable and target variable and the relationship among the various dependent 
variable. In the last 3 years, Bosting algorithm achieved popularity due to its robustness.
One of the very popular Boosting algorithms is LightGBM. It was developed by the Microsoft in 
2017, It used the histogram method due to which it is capable to handle High dimensional data. I 
used this framework for the prediction of NOx emission, I develop the dashboard to analyse the 
impact of the NOx parameters.
